<h1>FullStack Conference Site</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I've built this site to showcase the work I've done through Udacity's FrontEnd Nanodegree Program with Google. With this site I implemented bootstrap for the first time and learned even further about what a website would want based on the client. 


<h2>Build Status</h2>
This project is completed.


<h2>Tech/Frameworks used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Boostrap</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to Use?</h2>
Users can browse throughout the website and even "register" for the conference through forms in a modal window. It highlights speakers and gives an idea of what people can expect at this event.
